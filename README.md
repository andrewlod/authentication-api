# Authentication System API
The Authentication System API is a robust authentication system REST API built in TypeScript, designed to provide seamless user authentication and session management for web applications. With a focus on security and usability, this API allows users to effortlessly create accounts using their email addresses and facilitates session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Technologies
- TypeScript
- Node.js 20
- Prisma ORM (MySQL)
- AWS Secrets Manager

## Features
- **User Account Management:** Easily create user accounts using email addresses, providing a streamlined registration process for your application.
- **Session Management with JWT:** Manage user sessions securely using JSON Web Tokens, ensuring authenticated access to protected resources while minimizing vulnerabilities.
- **Safe Modification of Credentials:** Implement a safe and straightforward method for users to update their email addresses and passwords, maintaining the integrity and security of user accounts.
- **Credential Storage:** Passwords are securely encrypted through hashing in a MySQL Database, ensuring maximum protection against unauthorized access.
- **Admin User Support:** Administrators can efficiently manage user accounts and permissions, ensuring smooth operations and scalability for your application.
- **Sensitive Application Data:** Safeguard sensitive application data with AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage and management.

## Getting Started
This step describes the prerequisites and install steps for the libraries needed to build and run the project.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

### Installing
First of all, you must clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/andrewlod/authentication-api.git
```

Then install all dependencies:
```sh
cd authentication-api
npm install
npm run install-db
npm run migrate
```

### Environment
This project uses environment variables on non-production environment and a mix of environment variables and AWS Secrets Manager secrets on production environment. In order to setup the development environment, create a `.env` file in the root of this project, paste the following configuration and fill in the blank variables:
```env
# Environment Variables
SV_PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_STRATEGY=CONSOLE

SECRETS_CONNECTOR=AWS
# If this is not a production environment, the next variable may be left as blank
SECRETS_LIST=

DATABASE_URL="mysql://<username>:<password>@localhost:3306/<schema_name>?schema=public"

# Secrets
PASSWORD_SALT=
JWT_SECRET=
JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES=
JWT_COOKIE_KEY=
```

## Build & Run
